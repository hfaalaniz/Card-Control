# Card-Control
Card Control is a control to display data from a database or just add data individually.

How to use:
Download or clone the control, add it to your project, compile and enjoy.

The control has all the properties needed to manipulate box color, box line widths, text font and text color.

It has a top box called "title" and a bottom box called "body".

Any image of any size can be uploaded into the top box, and the control will adjust it to the required display size.

The bottom box also has a picturebox into which any image can be uploaded.

The top picturebox margins can be adjusted so that the image does not touch the edges.
